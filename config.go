// Configuration is platform-neutral here: this file knows how to read the
// shared TOML file and overlay the environment, but nothing about which app
// stores exist or what credentials they need. Each platform owns its own
// credential struct, env vars, and validation — see config_play.go for the
// pattern a new platform copies.
//
// Resolution order (later wins): TOML file (if present) < environment
// variables. Credentials are most commonly supplied via the environment so the
// MCP host config and CI never need a file on disk.

// decodeConfigFile decodes the TOML config selected by path into dst and
// returns the file it read. An empty path means "use the default path if it
// exists"; when no file is found dst is left untouched and the returned path is
// empty, which is the env-only case.
//
// The path comes back because a platform may have to rewrite the exact file its
// values were read out of, not whatever the default resolves to today.
